# Introduction to Git Machete

[git-machete](https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete) helps manage stacked PRs.
The point of this project is to find out whether this tool would be helpful in
my workflow.

Why I'm interested:
- Adds to the git interface (doesn't modify or replace it)
- I'm curious if it helps maintaining multiple branches for multiple stacked PRs
